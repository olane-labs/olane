# Dual License: MIT OR Apache-2.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Olane Inc.

Olane OS is dual-licensed under your choice of either:

- **MIT License** (LICENSE-MIT or https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
- **Apache License, Version 2.0** (LICENSE-APACHE or https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## Why Dual Licensing?

Dual licensing provides developers with flexibility when integrating Olane OS into their projects:

- **Choose MIT**: If you prefer a simple, permissive license without patent provisions
- **Choose Apache 2.0**: If you desire explicit patent protection and other features of the Apache license

You may choose either license to govern your use of this software.
