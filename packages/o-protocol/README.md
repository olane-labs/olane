# o-protocol

A protocol designed for complex communication with anything

## Overview
The o-network addressing system provides a hierarchical, federated approach to AI agent communication across distributed networks. This protocol enables AI agents to discover, access, and interact with tools and services through a simple yet powerful addressing scheme that scales from individual consumer networks to enterprise provider networks.

## Key Features
- Hierarchical P2P Network Structure - The primary use case is for resolving addresses within the o-network, a hierarchical federated network of p2p nodes [link to o-network README.md]
- Universal Address Format - Example: o://network_name/node_group_name/node_name/node_tool/node_tool_method
- Middleware-Enabled Routing - Each term within the address represents a p2p node that contains its own functionality that can be leveraged as middleware on its route to the destination leaf node
- AI-Native Workflow Language - This simplistic address structure allows AI to create a common language for workflow structures which can be shared
- Composable Plans - Combining multiple addresses is also possible resulting in Plans [link to plans README.md], which are also addressable and shareable too
- Self-Improving Intelligence - As AI Agents think about how to accomplish a task within the context of an o-network, failure and success alike become context for how to achieve a better solution or resolve a previous failure


The addressing protocol transforms simple intents into executable plans, automatically caching successful workflows for future use and creating an evolving intelligence layer that improves over time.

## Action Complete & Deterministic Outcomes

### Hyper-Personalization

## Why Build This?
The current internet evolved around a world that lacked intelligence as a service, resulting in static workflows masqueraded as APIs or websites. With the advent of LLMs, the world is quickly adapting and in dire need of an infrastructure that can match this new dynamic / fluid system.
