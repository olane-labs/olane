# Olane Gateways

TLDR; think DNS registrars but for olane. These bad boys help organize how the first term in the olane addresses are resolved (`o://brendon`). 

## What is this?
An Olane gateway is a registry tool. These registries help prevent conflicting namespaces, bridge into walled gardens, broker communication, and much more.

The Olane gateway dream: to create a system of trust for AI agents, Humans, and other future entities to collaborate safely.
