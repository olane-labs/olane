TLDR; The future proof digital front door for both AI and Humans. (Think “MCP for humans/AIs”)

*We recommend reading about o-nodes & olane network prior to this.*

**Agent definition**: an entity that acts on behalf of another individual, organization, or entity to carry out specific tasks, make decisions, or represent interests.

## What is this?

A 2-way communication framework that turns a human or AI into an o-node (link to o-node). 

By entering an olane network through this, the following happens:

1. Allows the agent to utilize the olane network
2. Advertises your own capabilities to the network 
    1. If the agent is human, perhaps you want to advertise that you are the owner and have access to various API keys or insights into how to get something done
    2. If your network spans multiple humans (AKA a company), perhaps you may want to segment roles to better inform AI agents on how they should view / engage with you
    3. If your network spans multiple devices, perhaps you may want to advertise which front door you most recently used. Thus, allowing AI to magically “follow you” along your journey between devices.
3. Allows the agent to collaborate with other agents

## Examples

1. Slack door
2. Telegram door
3. iMessage door
4. Email door
5. Network-to-network → middleware broker

## Why build this?

TLDR; we needed an MCP for humans & AIs.

There is no standard that represents where or how an AI should talk to you.
