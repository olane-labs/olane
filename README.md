**Benefits of running everything on a personal and private superintelligent network**

- Infrastructure *that **thinks***
- Infrastructure *that **self-improves***
- Infrastructure *that **communicates with anything**
(Humans, AI agents, protocols like HTTP, TCP, A2A, MCP, APIs, Tools, etc.)*
- Infrastructure *that's **owned by you** and is **device & system agnostic***
- Infrastructure *that‚Äôs **zero trust, quantum-encrypted, with continuous MFA enabled***

## Olane Overview

**Olane** is a peer-to-peer, secure, hierarchical AI network designed to organize data, resources, tools, and intelligent processes.

Within an olane network, AI agents can perform long-running tasks using sensitive tooling inside a dedicated, private, and secure sandboxed environment.

**Key Concepts**

1. **o:// o-protocol**
    
    The `o://` protocol enables seamless communication and coordination across agents, tools, and networks.
    
2. **o-networks**
    
    Olane networks (`o-network`) transform every tool, data point, or intelligent action into a resolvable [o-address](https://github.com/olane-labs/o-protocol-private) ‚Äî for example:
    
    `o://my-o-network/mcp/send email to client`

    More on [olane hierarchical organization](/docs/NETWORK_HIERARCHY.md) and why it is the [future of AI infrastructure](/docs/FUTURE_AI_INFRA.md).
    
3. **Interconnected Intelligence**
    
    o-addresses can be shared across networks, enabling secure, intelligent communication and knowledge sharing between organizations or agents:
    
    `o://share "o://my-network/mcp/send email" with my company's o-network`

## **Get started**

Building on olane is easy, this section will quickly teach you how to:

1. [Create your own network](#create-a-network)
2. [Use your own network](#use-your-network)
    1. Build and Personalize
    2. Monitor and Track
3. [Connect with other networks](#learning)
    1. Access knowledge skills
    2. Share knowledge skills
    3. Communicate across bridges
4. Checkout out our¬†[start building](/docs/START_BUILDING.md)¬†page for more advanced topics and use cases

## **INSTALL üéâ**

**Create your intelligent network üåê**

Follow these steps to create and start your olane network called `my-network`. 

```bash
# install the cli tool
# clone the cli repo
npm install -g @olane/o-cli

# create your first network
olane create -p 4444 my-network

# start your network
olane start -d my-network
```

*About your intelligent network:*
*Every network comes out of the box with [tools](https://github.com/olane-labs/o-network-private/blob/main)¬†

## RUN üèÉ

**Use your intelligent network**

1. Join your network ‚ûï
```bash
# join the network
olane join my-network
```
2. Talk to your network via "intent" (resolution) üó£Ô∏è

```bash
# a secure network connection is created
# Add new functionality like an MCP server
> Add linear to my network
.....Searching for linear context
.....OAuth access is required, continue to login? (You will need browser access)
.....Confirmed login success, creating a new node at location "o://my-network/mcp/linear"
.....44 New skills discovered through this node!
.....Intent success. Result: Network node added! Knowledge captured at o://plan/12345678910
.....Your network "my-network" will now analyze linear to understand more about it and how you use it.

# Assess your network's understanding of the data and tooling it contains
> Who am I?
.....Searching "my-network" for context
.....Analyzing "my-network" context
.....Summarizing
.....You are a software engineer with a passion for anime. Your daily routine revolves around a mixture of client projects.... 

# Assign jobs to your network (*coming soon)
> Update me on the S&P 500 through Warren Buffet's perspective every morning 
when the markets open

-----teach your network with policies----

> Policy creation intent: "Whenever someone tries to join my network, ask me first"
....Confirmed, I will make sure to follow this policy (undo?)
> Policy creation intent: "When trying to send a message to someone, first check my contact list for their phone number"
> "Whenever I chat with Dillon, use slack and use the appropriate slack thread"
...Thinking, can you confirm which Dillon? (Dillon Morgan or Dillon Johnson)
```

**When running your intelligent network:**
- Your network self-heals and learns to become deterministic & stateful (read advance mode)
- Add policies to your network to customize (read policy to learn more)
- Pro tip: Visualize your network with the [cli tool](/docs/CLI.md)

## **NETWORK TO NETWORK üõú**

**Connect to other intelligent networks üß†**

1. Collaboration leads to super intelligence (think hive mind / AI-social network)
2. Simple share anything via ‚Äúo-addresses‚Äù (think AI-telepathy)

```bash
# request to join network
# olane request to join public-intelligent-network
olane connect o://my-network --to=o://olane
....Connected!
....Discovered 232 skills, do you want to remember these?[y/n]
....Your network shares 31 o-addresses, would you like to collaborate with olane to help with intents involving these addresses in the future?

# network requests accepted
# Request or contribute knowledge to connected networks
# Share my knowledge of how to connect to MCPs
# Share my compute resources for projects that align with my personal beliefs
# Request knowledge for creating 3D DNA structures

# Collaborate with networks to solve challenging problems
> Create a non-hardware product that solves one key aspect of world hunger for 
under $10
```

**When communicating with other intelligent networks:**
- Your networks are building shared intelligence
- How to register with olane to enable human readable network name
- If you want to connect directly to another network that is not verified with olane, simply share the transport with the other network [What is a transport](url)

> **P2P Network Connection**: to connect directly to another network via the p2p functionality, simply share the network leader node transport with your intended collaborator. To learn more, read about [direct networking](/docs/DIRECT_NETWORKING.md)
