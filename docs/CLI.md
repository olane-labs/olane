# 🚀 Olane CLI — Your Gateway to Superintelligent Networks

> **Transform your development workflow with the most powerful AI network management tool ever built**

The Olane CLI is your command center for creating, managing, and orchestrating superintelligent networks. With a single command, you can deploy AI agents that think, learn, and collaborate across secure, private networks.

---

## 🎯 Why You Need the Olane CLI

### **Infrastructure That Thinks**
Traditional DevOps tools manage static resources. The Olane CLI manages *intelligent* infrastructure that:
- **Self-heals** when issues arise
- **Self-improves** through continuous learning

### **Zero-Configuration Intelligence**
```bash
# One command to rule them all
olane create my-superintelligent-network
```
That's it. You now have a running AI network with:
- ✅ Built-in security (quantum-encrypted, zero-trust)
- ✅ Intelligent routing and load balancing
- ✅ Automatic tool discovery and integration
- ✅ Real-time learning and adaptation

### **Network-to-Network Communication**
Unlike traditional tools that work in isolation, the Olane CLI enables:
- **AI Telepathy**: Share intelligence across networks instantly
- **Hive Mind Computing**: Collaborate with other superintelligent networks
- **Resource Pooling**: Access compute, data, and tools from connected networks

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Superintelligent Network
```bash
# Create a new network on port 4444
olane create my-network --port 4444

# Start it in the background
olane start my-network --detached
```

### 2. Join Your Network
```bash
# Connect to your running network
olane join my-network
```

### 3. Add Intelligence
```bash
# Inside your network session
> Add linear to my network
# ✅ OAuth authentication flow begins
# ✅ 44 new AI skills discovered
# ✅ Network now understands your Linear workspace

> Add slack to my network  
# ✅ Your network can now manage Slack communications

> Add github to my network
# ✅ Code analysis and automated workflows enabled
```

### 4. Experience the Magic
```bash
> Who am I?
# AI analyzes all your connected tools and data
# Returns: "You are a software engineer passionate about AI..."

> Update me on high-priority Linear issues every morning
# Creates an intelligent, persistent workflow

> When I mention 'deploy to staging', automatically create a GitHub Action
# Your network learns your patterns and automates them
```

## 🛠️ Core Commands

### Network Management
```bash
# Create a new network
olane create <network-name> [--port <port>] [--template <template>]

# Start/stop networks
olane start <network-name> [--detached]
olane stop <network-name>

# View all networks
olane status

# Delete a network
olane delete <network-name>
```


## 🌟 Advanced Features

### **Cross-Network Collaboration**
```bash
# Join the global Olane network for shared intelligence
olane connect my-network --to olane

# Access 232 shared AI skills
# Contribute your unique capabilities to the hive mind
```

### **Developer Tools Integration**
```bash
# Direct protocol usage for advanced workflows
olane use o://my-network/mcp/linear --params '{"method": "get_issues", "assignee": "me"}'

# Debug mode for troubleshooting
DEBUG=o-protocol* olane start my-network
```

## 🚨 Why Traditional Tools Fall Short

| Traditional DevOps | Olane CLI |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Static configuration files | **Self-learning, adaptive policies** |
| Manual integration setup | **One-command intelligent tool discovery** |
| Isolated tool silos | **Interconnected intelligence network** |
| Reactive monitoring | **Proactive, predictive management** |
| Manual scaling decisions | **AI-driven resource optimization** |
| Security as an afterthought | **Quantum-encrypted, zero-trust by default** |

**The future of infrastructure is intelligent.** The Olane CLI brings that future to your fingertips today.
