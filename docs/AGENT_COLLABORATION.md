What is an agent?

In olane, it is an actor that has joined the network that is capable of providing real time intelligence.<br>
Agents can be:
- Human
- AI
- Olane Networks
- Whatever else the future may hold

### Why are agents important?
Currently, humans hold access to the sensitive information that AI agents need in order to be truly successful. This includes:
- API Keys
- Credentials
- Relevant context
- Inter-personal context
- Much more

Every network starts with zero agents, meaning no human or AI is operating within the network. Once the owner of the network joins, they join as an authorized agent. Assuming the owner is human, they adopt the `o://agent/human` protocol and can interface with the network by simply talking to it.
