# Package Overview

Olane OS is composed of modular packages organized in three architectural layers. This guide helps you understand the package ecosystem and choose the right packages for your use case.

## What You'll Learn

- How Olane packages are organized into layers
- The purpose and responsibility of each package
- Which packages to use for your specific use case
- How packages work together to create intelligent agents

## The Three-Layer Architecture

Olane OS follows a layered architecture where **AI agents are the users**, **tool nodes are the applications**, and **Olane packages are the operating system**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  USERS: AI Agents                                │
│  - Generalist reasoning brains (GPT-4, Claude)   │
│  - Natural language interfaces                   │
│  - Intent-driven interactions                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ⬇ use
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  APPLICATIONS: Tool Nodes & Capabilities         │
│  - Domain-specific tools (CRM, analytics, etc.)  │
│  - Business integrations (APIs, databases)       │
│  - Specialized capabilities (search, compute)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ⬇ run on
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OPERATING SYSTEM: Olane Runtime                 │
│  - Process management (o-lane)                   │
│  - Tool system (o-tool)                          │
│  - IPC & networking (o-node, o-core)             │
│  - Coordination (o-leader)                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Understanding the Layers

**Users (AI Agents)**: The intelligent consumers who interact with the system using natural language. They make requests, express intents, and coordinate with other agents.

**Applications (Tool Nodes)**: The specialized capabilities and integrations that agents invoke to accomplish tasks. These are the domain-specific tools you build.

**Operating System (Olane)**: The runtime infrastructure that manages processes, handles communication, coordinates agents, and provides the foundation for everything to work together.

<Tip>
Most developers build **applications** (tool nodes) that run on the **OS** (Olane packages) and are used by **agents** (LLMs with specialized context).
</Tip>

---

## Layer 1: Kernel (Foundation)

The kernel layer provides abstract infrastructure for agent runtimes. These packages define **how** agents work without implementing specific transport mechanisms.

### @olane/o-core

**The agent runtime kernel**

Provides the foundational infrastructure for creating and managing AI agents:

- Agent lifecycle management (start, stop, states)
- Hierarchical addressing system (`o://` protocol)
- Inter-agent communication (IPC) abstractions
- Routing and connection management
- Parent-child hierarchy support
- Metrics and observability

**Think of it as:** The Linux kernel - defines how processes work but doesn't implement hardware drivers.

**Use when:**
- Building custom transport implementations
- Creating new agent runtime architectures
- Research and experimentation
- You don't need networking (local/single-process agents)

### @olane/o-protocol

**Type definitions and protocol specifications**

Defines the contracts and interfaces for Olane OS:

- Request/Response types (JSON-RPC 2.0 based)
- Error codes and error types
- Node types (LEADER, AGENT, TOOL)
- Method metadata structures
- Configuration interfaces

**Think of it as:** The POSIX standard - defines how things should work across implementations.

**Use when:**
- You need type definitions for TypeScript projects
- Building protocol-compatible implementations
- Understanding the communication format

[Learn more about o-protocol →](/packages/o-protocol)

### @olane/o-config

**Configuration utilities and helpers**

Provides pre-configured settings for libp2p and system setup:

- libp2p transport configurations
- Connection manager presets
- Bootstrap node lists
- Network configuration helpers

**Use when:**
- Setting up production network configurations
- Customizing libp2p behavior
- Managing bootstrap nodes

[Learn more about o-config →](/packages/o-config)

---

## Layer 2: Framework (Production Implementation)

The framework layer provides production-ready implementations and agent augmentation systems. Most developers spend their time here.

### @olane/o-node

**P2P networking for agents**

Production-ready libp2p implementation that makes agents work over real peer-to-peer networks:

- Automatic peer discovery (DHT, mDNS, bootstrap nodes)
- NAT traversal and relay protocols
- Multiple transport support (TCP, WebSocket, WebRTC, QUIC)
- Persistent agent identity
- Connection security and gating

**Think of it as:** Ubuntu/Fedora - a complete, production-ready Linux distribution. While `o-core` is the kernel spec, `o-node` is the actual working OS.

**Use when:**
- Building agents that need real networking
- Agents on different machines need to communicate
- You want production-ready P2P capabilities
- Need automatic peer discovery

[Learn more about o-node →](/packages/o-node)

### @olane/o-tool

**Tool augmentation system**

Convention-based system for adding discoverable capabilities to agents:

- Tool registration via `_tool_` prefix convention
- Automatic parameter validation
- Tool discovery via vector stores
- Mixin architecture (add tools to any class)
- Built-in lifecycle tools

**Think of it as:** System calls and libraries - how applications invoke OS functionality.

**How it works:**
```typescript
class MyTool extends oToolBase {
  // _tool_ prefix = executable method
  async _tool_analyze(request) { 
    return { analysis: 'complete' };
  }
  
  // _params_ prefix = parameter schema
  _params_analyze() { 
    return { 
      data: { type: 'string', required: true } 
    };
  }
}
```

**Use when:**
- Creating specialized agent capabilities
- Building discoverable tools
- Need automatic parameter validation
- Want convention over configuration

[Learn more about o-tool →](/packages/o-tool)

### @olane/o-lane

**Intent-driven process management**

Manages agentic workflows through capability-based loops, transforming natural language intents into coordinated actions:

- Intent-driven execution (natural language goals)
- Capability-based execution loop (evaluate → decide → execute)
- Execution sequence tracking and audit trails
- Real-time streaming support
- Content-addressed storage
- Sub-lane spawning

**Think of it as:** systemd or the process scheduler - manages running processes for AI agents.

**The capability loop:**
```
1. EVALUATE → Agent analyzes intent and current state
2. DECIDE   → Agent picks next capability
3. EXECUTE  → Capability performs action
4. RECORD   → Add to sequence history
5. CHECK    → Done? If no, loop back to EVALUATE
```

**Use when:**
- Agents need to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks
- Want emergent workflow discovery (not pre-defined graphs)
- Need execution history and audit trails
- Prefer intent-driven over procedural execution

[Learn more about o-lane →](/packages/o-lane)

### @olane/o-leader

**Network coordination**

Root coordinator node for agent networks, providing centralized discovery and coordination:

- Network entry point for joining agents
- Agent discovery registry
- Network-wide capability indexing
- Join request validation
- Parent-child relationship management
- Health coordination

**Think of it as:** The init process (PID 1) or DNS - the root service that bootstraps the system.

**Use when:**
- Building multi-agent systems
- Agents need to discover each other
- Want centralized coordination
- Need network-wide capability indexing

[Learn more about o-leader →](/packages/o-leader)

## Layer 3: Applications (Your Tool Nodes)

This is where you build domain-specific tool nodes and capabilities that AI agents use to accomplish tasks.

**Examples:**
- Financial analysis tools (revenue calculation, trend analysis, forecasting)
- CRM integration tools (customer lookup, ticket creation, data sync)
- Data pipeline tools (ETL operations, data validation, transformation)
- Research tools (web search, document analysis, citation management)

**What you're building:** The specialized capabilities that agents invoke, not the agents themselves. The agents (LLMs) use your tools through the Olane OS.
