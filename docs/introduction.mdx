# Welcome to Olane

Olane is an addressable peer-to-peer (p2p) node platform that enables you to host tools, data, or anything else your heart can dream of. Built with modern web technologies and designed for scalability, Olane provides a robust foundation for decentralized applications and services.

## What is Olane?

Olane is a comprehensive platform that allows developers to:

- **Create addressable nodes** that can be discovered and accessed across the network
- **Host diverse content** from simple data to complex applications
- **Build p2p networks** with reliable communication protocols
- **Scale applications** with distributed architecture

## Architecture Overview

Olane's architecture is built around the concept of addressable nodes that form a distributed network. Each node can:

- Maintain its own state and data
- Communicate with other nodes in the network
- Provide services to other nodes or external clients
- Participate in network-wide protocols and consensus mechanisms
