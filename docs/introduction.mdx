## What is Olane OS?

**Olane OS is an operating system for AI agents.** Just as traditional operating systems manage processes, memory, and resources for applications, Olane OS provides the runtime infrastructure for AI agents to operate as intelligent, addressable processes that communicate, coordinate, and learn from each other.

This is **not** a network framework, API library, or orchestration tool—it's a complete runtime system that fundamentally changes how you build with AI agents.

## Why Olane OS?

### The Problem with Current AI Agent Systems

Building production AI agent systems today requires:

- **Fine-tuning separate models** for each domain ($$$$ and slow)
- **Pre-defining workflow graphs** that can't adapt (LangGraph, etc.)
- **Manual orchestration** that breaks as systems scale
- **Reinventing infrastructure** for every new agent

### The Olane OS Solution

Olane OS introduces three architectural innovations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generalist-Specialist Architecture" icon="users-gear">
    **One LLM brain, many specialized agents.** Instead of fine-tuning separate models, use a single generalist model (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) as the reasoning brain for all agents. Specialization happens through:
    
    - **Context Injection**: Domain-specific knowledge
    - **Tool Augmentation**: Specialized capabilities  
    - **Knowledge Accumulation**: Learning from interactions
    
    **Result**: 70-90% cost reduction vs separate fine-tuned models
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Emergent vs Explicit Orchestration" icon="diagram-project">
    **Agents discover workflows, not follow them.** Unlike LangGraph's pre-defined state graphs, Olane OS agents autonomously determine optimal execution paths through a capability-based loop:
    
    - Agents **evaluate** their current state and intent
    - Agents **decide** which capability to use next
    - Agents **learn** from execution history
    - Workflows **emerge** from agent intelligence
    
    **Result**: Workflows that improve over time through collective learning
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hierarchical Organization" icon="folder-tree">
    **Filesystem-like addressing for agents.** The `o://` protocol provides:
    
    - Natural resource organization (`o://company/finance/reporting`)
    - Automatic context inheritance from hierarchical position
    - Intelligent routing through agent hierarchies
    - Built-in fault tolerance and failover paths
    
    **Result**: Intuitive agent organization that mirrors business structure
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's how you create an intelligent agent that can autonomously accomplish complex tasks:

```typescript
import { oLaneTool, oIntent } from '@olane/o-lane';
import { oAddress } from '@olane/o-core';

// Create a specialized agent with custom tools
class AnalyticsAgent extends oLaneTool {
  constructor() {
    super({
      address: new oAddress('o://company/analytics'),
      description: 'Data analysis specialist agent'
    });
  }

  // Add domain-specific tools
  async _tool_fetch_sales_data(request) {
    // Your data fetching logic
    return { data: salesData, period: 'Q4' };
  }

  async _tool_analyze_trends(request) {
    // Your analysis logic
    return { trends: analysis, insights: insights };
  }
}

// Start the agent
const agent = new AnalyticsAgent();
await agent.start();

// Give it a natural language intent - agent figures out how to execute
const result = await agent.useSelf({
  method: 'intent',
  params: {
    intent: 'Analyze Q4 sales trends and identify top-performing regions'
  }
});

// Agent autonomously:
// 1. Evaluates the intent
// 2. Decides to fetch sales data
// 3. Calls _tool_fetch_sales_data
// 4. Analyzes the data
// 5. Generates insights
// 6. Returns formatted results

console.log(result.result);
// "Q4 sales analysis complete. Top regions: Northeast (+25%), West (+18%)..."
```

**What just happened?**

1. You created a specialized agent with domain tools
2. You gave it a natural language goal (intent)
3. The agent **autonomously discovered** the optimal execution path
4. No workflow graphs, no state machines, no manual orchestration

## How It Works

Olane OS is organized in three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR AGENTS: Domain-specific AI agents         │
│  - Customer service, analytics, automation      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ⬇ built with
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FRAMEWORK: Olane OS Packages                   │
│  - o-lane: Process management & workflows       │
│  - o-tool: Tool augmentation system             │
│  - o-node: P2P networking                       │
│  - o-leader: Network coordination               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ⬇ powered by
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  KERNEL: Core Runtime                           │

│  - o-protocol: Type definitions                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Agentic Process Model

Just as an operating system manages processes, Olane OS manages **agentic processes**:

1. **Agents are processes** with unique addresses (`o://company/dept/agent`)
2. **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** happens via the `o://` protocol
3. **Resource management** through hierarchical addressing
4. **Process coordination** through emergent orchestration
5. **State persistence** with checkpointing and recovery
